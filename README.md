\# Endee-Based Semantic Search and RAG (Mock Implementation)



\## Overview

This project demonstrates a complete \*\*Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)\*\* pipeline using an \*\*Endee-style vector database workflow\*\*.



The system performs:

\- Document ingestion

\- Text embedding generation

\- Vector similarity search (semantic search)

\- Context retrieval for question answering



Due to environment and network constraints in running the Endee OSS server and large language models locally, a lightweight \*\*mock vector database\*\* and \*\*mock LLM response\*\* are used to demonstrate the full architecture and logic.
